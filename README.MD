<h1>Playing around with Mapbox geocoding</h1>
<p>Made a map that lets you geolocate yourself, or geocode any address. On either event, the page makes an AJAX call to the <a href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/">Open Notify API</a>, which sends back information about the next pass of the International Space Station for that latitude and longitude. The map then renders a popup over your location populated with some of that information.</p>
